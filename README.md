## Welcome to "Laser Defender" !

This single player game is a clone of Galaga. The game was built as a solo project following a course on Udemy and used to learn about projectiles, spawners and gameplay systems. The player controls a single ship and must destroy waves of enemy ships which appear at varying speeds and health. The player increases their score depending on the difficulty of the enemy destroyed.
